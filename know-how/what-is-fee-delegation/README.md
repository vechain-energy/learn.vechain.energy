# What is Fee Delegation?

In the world of crypto and web3 the user who sends a transaction pays a fee.

Fee delegation is a feature that allows someone else to pay for it.

Removing the need to pay for a fee reduces the interaction of a user to creating a transaction and signing it.

## Why is it important?

It stops users from instantly using an application.

Users that need to pay for transactions are required to obtain a token from somewhere. Regular users do not know where to go and researching a place to buy and accessing a (de)centralized exchange is too much to ask for a user that wants to use your application.

## What does it allow?

Users can open an application and interact with it instantly. An Application can submit transactions in the background and can no longer be be distinguished from regular (web2) alternatives.

Fee delegation solves the biggest hurdle of user on-boarding to blockchain-applications without invalidating the web3-principles.
