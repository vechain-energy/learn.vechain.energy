# Execute Functions

A function changing a state requires a transaction. The transaction needs to be signed by an origin before it is added to the blockchain.

## Example Conditions

### Source Code

The VTHO contract's source code is available on GitHub:\
[https://github.com/vechain/thor/blob/f58c17ae50f1ec8698d9daf6e05076d17dcafeaf/builtin/gen/energy.sol](https://github.com/vechain/thor/blob/f58c17ae50f1ec8698d9daf6e05076d17dcafeaf/builtin/gen/energy.sol)

### Contract address

The public VTHO contract is used. Address is identical on Test and MainNet.

```solidity
0x0000000000000000000000000000456E65726779
```

### ABI

Definition of the `transfer` that transfers VTHO to another address.

```json
{
  constant: false,
  inputs: [
    {
      name: "_to",
      type: "address"
    },
    {
      name: "_amount",
      type: "uint256"
    }
  ],
  name: "transfer",
  outputs: [
    {
      name: "success",
      type: "bool"
    }
  ],
  payable: false,
  stateMutability: "nonpayable",
  type: "function"
}
```

### Function definition

```solidity
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _amount) public {}
```

### Connex Example

```typescript
const clause = connex.thor
  .account(CONTRACT_ADDRESS)
  .method(abi)
  .asClause(address, 0);

const result = await connex.vendor
  .sign("tx", [clause])
//  .delegate(DELEGATE_URL) // only if fee delegation is used
  .request();

console.log(result)
```
