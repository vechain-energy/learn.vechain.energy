# Events & Logs

Events are signals that are emitted from smart contracts. Every event is logged, immutable and accessable using a blockchain node only. Smart contracts can not access events themself.

Client-Applications can either listen to events and act accordingly or use logged events to access historical data.

The example uses a public contract and paginates thru the results.

## Conditions

### Source Code

The VTHO contract's source code is available on GitHub:\
[https://github.com/vechain/thor/blob/f58c17ae50f1ec8698d9daf6e05076d17dcafeaf/builtin/gen/energy.sol](https://github.com/vechain/thor/blob/f58c17ae50f1ec8698d9daf6e05076d17dcafeaf/builtin/gen/energy.sol)

### Contract address

The public VTHO contract is used. Address is identical on Test and MainNet.

```solidity
0x0000000000000000000000000000456E65726779
```

### ABI

Definition of the `event Transfer` that is emitted on every VTHO Transfer.

```json
 {
    "anonymous": false,
    "inputs": [
        {
            "indexed": true,
            "name": "_from",
            "type": "address"
        },
        {
            "indexed": true,
            "name": "_to",
            "type": "address"
        },
        {
            "indexed": false,
            "name": "_value",
            "type": "uint256"
        }
    ],
    "name": "Transfer",
    "type": "event"
}
```

### Event definition

```solidity
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value);
```

### Connex Example using Account Visitor

```typescript
const event = connex.thor.account(CONTRACT_ADDRESS).event(ABI);
const logs = await event
  .filter([{ _to: address }])
  .order("desc")
  .apply(0, 20);
  
console.log(logs)
```

### Connex Example using Thor Filter

```typescript
import { abi } from "thor-devkit";

const coder = new abi.Event(ABI)
const topics = TransferCoder.encode({ _to: address });

const events = await connex.thor
  .filter("event", [
    {
      address: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
      topic0: topicsFrom[0] || undefined,
      topic1: topicsFrom[1] || undefined,
      topic2: topicsFrom[2] || undefined,
      topic3: topicsFrom[3] || undefined,
      topic4: topicsFrom[4] || undefined
    }
  ])
  .order("desc")
  .apply(0, 20);

const logs = events.map(event => {
  return {
    ...event,
    decoded: coder.decode(event.data, event.topics)
  };
})
console.log(logs)
```
