# How to read from contracts using ethers?

[ethers](https://docs.ethers.org/) is one of the prominent standard libraries used for interacting with "web3."

It is widely used, and if you come from a different ecosystem, using ethers might be a more straightforward way to get started rather than interacting with Connex directly.

By combining [@vechain/web3-providers-connex](https://github.com/vechain/web3-providers-connex#readme) (VeChain Connex) with ethers (v5), you can easily create the ability to interact with VeChain contracts.

## Setting Up the Provider

ethers requires a provider to understand how to interact with the blockchain and submit standard commands. Below is an example snippet that creates a provider for the VeChain MainNet:

```javascript
import Connex from "@vechain/connex";
import * as thor from '@vechain/web3-providers-connex'

// Connect to VeChain
const connex = new Connex({
  node: "https://node-mainnet.vechain.energy",
  network: "main"
});

// Inject VeChain Connex Connectivity into an ethers provider
const provider = thor.ethers.modifyProvider(
  new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(
    new thor.Provider({ connex })
  )
)
```

## Setting Up the Contract Interface

A generic contract interface can be configured using an address and its ABI. Here is an example for the VTHO Contract and its `totalSupply` function:


```js
// configure the VTHO contract like any other contract
const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = '0x0000000000000000000000000000456e65726779'
const ABI = [{
  name: "totalSupply",
  inputs: [],
  outputs: [{ internalType: "uint256", name: "vtho", type: "uint256" }],
  stateMutability: "view",
  type: "function"
}]
```

The interface is created using `ethers.Contract` and combines contract information with the provider:

```js
const VTHOContract = new ethers.Contract(CONTRACT_ADDRESS, ABI, provider);
```

## Using the Contract Interface

Interacting with the contract is simplified to a single async call that responds with the contract outputs:

```js
const totalSupply = await VTHOContract.totalSupply()
```
