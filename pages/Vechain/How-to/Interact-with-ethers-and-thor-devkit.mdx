# How to Interact with Vechain without Connex

> Connex is the standard interface to connect dApps with VeChain blockchain and users. Aiming to help developers building decentralized applications.

[Connex](https://docs.vechain.org/connex/api.html) is an excellent tool for interacting with VeChain, but it is limited to certain environments, and sometimes more flexibility is needed.

In this article, we will demonstrate how to interact with Vechain using [ethers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethers) and the [thor-devkit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/thor-devkit).

## Environment

For this example, we will set up a NodeJS script that uses an existing contract on the TestNet to call a contract function.

### Preparation

Before we begin, let's take note of the following details:

- Contract: [`0x8384738C995D49C5b692560ae688fc8b51af1059`](https://explore-testnet.vechain.org/accounts/0x8384738c995d49c5b692560ae688fc8b51af1059)
- Sponsorship-URL: `https://sponsor-testnet.vechain.energy/by/90`
- Node-URL: `https://node-testnet.vechain.energy`
- ABI:

```json
[
  {
    "inputs": [],
    "name": "counter",
    "outputs": [
      {
        "internalType": "uint256",
        "name": "",
        "type": "uint256"
      }
    ],
    "stateMutability": "view",
    "type": "function"
  },
  {
    "inputs": [],
    "name": "increment",
    "outputs": [],
    "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
    "type": "function"
  }
]
```


## Project Setup / Dependencies

First, let's set up the project and install the necessary dependencies using yarn:

```shell
yarn init -y
yarn add ethers thor-devkit bent
```

- `ethers` is used for building the binary instructions for chain communication.
- `thor-devkit` is used for Vechain-specific transaction wrapping and signing.
- `bent` is used as a simple fetch alternative.

To simplify HTTP interactions, bent is used to provide `get` and `post` functions for a Vechain Node and a function to fetch data from the vechain.energy delegation service:

```js
const get = bent('GET', 'https://node-testnet.vechain.energy', 'json')
const post = bent('POST', 'https://node-testnet.vechain.energy', 'json')
const getSponsorship = bent('POST', 'https://sponsor-testnet.vechain.energy', 'json')
```


## Build Transaction Call

Building the contract call in bytecode is provided by `ethers` and its `Interfaces`:

```js
const Counter = new ethers.Interface(abi)
const clauses = [{
  to: address,
  value: '0x0',
  data: Counter.encodeFunctionData("increment", [])
}]
```

Using interfaces, an ABI or function headers (signatures) can be used to generate an easy-to-use interaction interface.

If the function accepts arguments, they can be passed in the array of the `encodingFunctionData`.

Read more about it in the docs:  
https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/abi/#interfaces

The resulting data is stored in a list with clauses, which will be wrapped by a transaction in the next step.

## Generate Vechain Transaction

A transaction is required to submit the clauses and call the contracts. A transaction can be built with `thor-devkit` and requires chain related information:

```js
const { Transaction, secp256k1 } = require('thor-devkit')

const bestBlock = await get('/blocks/best')
const genesisBlock = await get('/blocks/0')

const transaction = new Transaction({
	chainTag: Number.parseInt(genesisBlock.id.slice(-2), 16),
	blockRef: bestBlock.id.slice(0, 18),
	expiration: 32,
	clauses,
	gas: bestBlock.gasLimit,
	gasPriceCoef: 0,
	dependsOn: null,
	nonce: Date.now(),
	reserved: {
	  features: 1
	}
})

```

Building the transaction has dependencies:

1. `chainTag` is a reference to the last byte of the genesis block (block #0) to ensure the transaction can not be re-used on different chains.
2. `blockRef` points to the point on the chain where the transaction relies on. It must be a valid one and the `expiration` will be based on that.
3. `gas` is in the example set to the maximum allowed in the latest block
4. `nonce` needs to be unique in the transaction pool but can otherwise be a tiny number to save gas fees.
5. `reserved` activates fee delegation, which can be left out if unwanted

# Bonus: Simulate Transaction

The results of the transaction can be simulated by posting the data to a node at `/accounts/*`.

The gas willing to be paid, optionally the caller that will send the transaction can be provided to get a complete result of what will happen.

A list is returned with the transfers and events that will happen on each clause. In case of an error `reverted` is returned as `true` and data can contain the hex-encoded revert-message of the involved contract.

```js
const tests = await post('/accounts/*', {
  clauses: transaction.body.clauses,
  caller: wallet.address,
  gas: transaction.body.gas
})

for (const test of tests) {
  if (test.reverted) {

    const revertReason = test.data.length > 10 ? ethers.AbiCoder.defaultAbiCoder().decode(['string'], `0x${test.data.slice(10)}`) : test.vmError
    throw new Error(revertReason)
  }
}
```


## Get Fee Delegation Signature

With fee delegation the transaction requires a signature from the gas payee.

The transaction can be received from a Fee Delegation Service by sending the transaction origin and the hex encoded transaction. As a result the hex-signature is returned and needs to be converted into a buffer:

```js
const { signature } = await getSponsorship('/by/90', { origin: wallet.address, raw: `0x${transaction.encode().toString('hex')}` })
const sponsorSignature = Buffer.from(signature.substr(2), 'hex')
```

Details about the inner workings of the service is described in VIP-201:  
https://github.com/vechain/VIPs/blob/master/vips/VIP-201.md


# Sign Transaction

`secp256k1` is used to create a signature for a hash of the transaction.

Without Fee Delegation it is a two liner:

```js
const signingHash = transaction.signingHash()
transaction.signature = secp256k1.sign(signingHash, Buffer.from(wallet.privateKey.slice(2), 'hex'))
```

With Fee Delegation, the signature of the gas payee is appended to the transaction signature:

```js
const signingHash = transaction.signingHash()
const originSignature = secp256k1.sign(signingHash, Buffer.from(wallet.privateKey.slice(2), 'hex'))
transaction.signature = Buffer.concat([originSignature, sponsorSignature])
```

## Submit Transaction

The built and signed transaction is submitted to the network with a POST to `/transactions`. This completes the transaction building:

```js
const rawTransaction = `0x${transaction.encode().toString('hex')}`
const { id } = await post('/transactions', { raw: rawTransaction })
```

Returned is a JSON with the transaction id for further tracking.

The id can be used to get details about the transaction status and its results.
