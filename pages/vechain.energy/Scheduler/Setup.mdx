## Create Address Book Entry
The contracts and functions can be organized in the Address Book. Select network, address and enter ABI to prevent re-entering the same information.

This example uses a `Counter` contract deployed on the Vechain TestNet.

Address:
```md copy
0x8384738c995d49c5b692560ae688fc8b51af1059
```

ABI:

```json copy
[
  {
    "inputs": [],
    "name": "counter",
    "outputs": [
      { "internalType": "uint256", "name": "", "type": "uint256" }
    ],
    "stateMutability": "view",
    "type": "function"
  },
  {
    "inputs": [],
    "name": "increment",
    "outputs": [],
    "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
    "type": "function"
  }
]
```

## Create Scheduler

A scheduler consist of three elements.

### Contract

The address of the contract and the ABI are used in combination to build a new transaction. Input for functions will automatically be required if the ABI lists them.

### Interval

The interval is in a crontab format with visual support to configure it without technical understanding.

The next runs are listed to confirm the next executions.

## Simulation

A simulation tests the transaction for a possible revert. If the contract will revert, the next transaction will be skipped. 

Simulations enable calling functions only when certain requirements are in place, without wasting gas fees with reverted transactions.

## Logs

In the Dashboard the combined information of the Scheduler Execution, Fee Delegation and the Transaction provides instant insight of each transaction.

The Execution Logs in the Schedulers-Section provide details about each execution.
