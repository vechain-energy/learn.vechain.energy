# Options

## Enable / Disable

Disabling a Scheduler pauses its execution. It can be resumed at any later state.

## Run for Testing

When activated, the Scheduler can be executed immediately with its valid configuration or contract functions.

## Clone

Cloning a Scheduler copies the configuration and creates a new identity.

## Identity

Every Scheduler has its own identity that can be used to configure access control on contracts. The origin address of the Scheduler is visible in the Editing-Form.
