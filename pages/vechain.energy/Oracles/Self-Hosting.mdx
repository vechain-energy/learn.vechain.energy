# How to Host Your Own Oracle Service

Here are the steps to host your own Oracle service:

- Sign up on [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com). This will host the backend using [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/).
- Sign up on [vechain.energy](https://vechain.energy) and set up [API-Relay](https://docs.vechain.energy/vechain.energy/API-Keys/). Make sure it's set to interact with everyone.
- Deploy the contracts on Vechain.
- Deploy the Backend on Cloudflare.
- Set up the Backend with your Data Sources.

### How to Deploy Contracts

* All contracts can be found at https://github.com/vechain-energy/oracle.vechain.energy/tree/main/contracts.
* Follow the instructions in that section to deploy them.

### How to Deploy Reporter

* The reporter can be found at https://github.com/vechain-energy/oracle.vechain.energy/tree/main/reporter.
* Follow the instructions in that section to deploy it.

### How to Set Up the Backend

Choose your Data Sources and find the JSON-Document-Path. Set up your feed configuration accordingly.

Here's an example for VET-USD from public sources:

```json
{
    "id":"vet-usd",
    "sources": [
        {
            "url": "https://api.coincap.io/v2/assets/vechain",
            "path": ".data.priceUsd"
        }
    ],
    "heartbeat": 3600,
    "deviationPoints": 100,
    "interval": 60,
    "contract": {
        "nodeUrl": "https://node-testnet.vechain.energy",
        "address": "<0x_Deployed_Oracle_Contract_Address>"
    }
}
```

Save it as `feed-config.json` and POST it to your backend.

Here's how to do it:

```shell
curl -XPOST http://localhost:8787/unique-id \
-H "X-API-Key: ${API_KEY}" \
--data-binary "@feed-config.json"
```

### How to Test

You can check if your service is working by visiting your deployed backend's status URL. Append the `unique-id` of your feed.

Here's an example using the public setup:
* https://oracle.vechain.energy/test-vet-usd

This will confirm that everything is running with the configuration and the last value:

```json
{
    "id": "vet-usd",
    "nextUpdate": 1702637786436,
    "healthy": true,
    "config": {
        "interval": 300,
        "heartbeat": 3600,
        "deviationPoints": 100
    },
    "latestValue": {
        "id": "vet-usd",
        "updatedAt": 1702637485,
        "value": "29912757636",
        "formattedValue": "0.029912757636"
    }
}
```
