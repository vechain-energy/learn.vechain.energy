# What is an Oracle?

An Oracle is a source of trusted information, often used to provide token prices.


## Interface

The contract interface for all oracles is:

```solidity
interface IVechainEnergyOracleV1 {
    // emitted when data changes
    event ValueUpdate(bytes32 id, uint128 value, uint128 updatedAt);

    // access value for a given feed id
    function getLatestValue(bytes32 id) external view returns (uint128 value, uint128 updatedAt);

    // allows everyone to update values using a verified & signed responses from the public API
    function updateValueWithProof(bytes memory message, bytes memory extraData, address signedFor) external;
}
```

* `id` is a byte32 encoded version of the feed identifier (for example `vet-usd`)
* `value` is the value provided by the oracle
* `updatedAt` is the unix timestamp when the value was last determined


## Source Code

The components needed to run the oracle are open-sourced. This helps developers build and manage oracle services on Vechain.

The project includes smart contracts for storing data on-chain and a backend that updates this on-chain data. The oracle service can be customized to support various data sources and multiple feeds. It also offers a public API to get the most recent data from sources, even if it hasn't been stored on-chain yet.
