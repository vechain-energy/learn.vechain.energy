# What is an Oracle?

An Oracle is a source of trusted information, often used to provide token prices.

vechain.energy operates oracles that supply relevant data.

## Source Code

The elements needed to run the oracle are open-sourced. This helps developers build and manage oracle services on Vechain.

The project includes smart contracts for storing data on-chain and a backend that updates this on-chain data. The oracle service can be customized to support various data sources and multiple feeds. It also offers a public API to get the most recent data from sources, even if it hasn't been stored on-chain yet.
