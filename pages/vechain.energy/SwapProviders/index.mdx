# What are Swap Providers?

A Swap Provider allows your users to swap tokens on your platform.

## Why is it important?

Sending users away to other platforms to swap tokens is a bad user experience and creates potential user loss.

Embed a form on your website that allows users to swap tokens from different networks without leaving your platform. Users can stay on your website and will have a better experience.

## How does it work?

Every Swap Provider has a unique link that can be embedded as an IFrame. The IFrame shows a form for the swap and a status for the swap-process.
