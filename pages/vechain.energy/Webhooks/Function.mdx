# Webhook Function

A webhook function is a pure JavaScript function that runs in an isolated environment as the final processing step before passing it to the receiving endpoint.

In the environment access to blockchain data is provided and the ability to fetch data from the internet.

The returned value is passed to the configured Endpoint.

## How it works

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Blockchain->>Webhook: Trigger Event
    Webhook-->>Webhook: prepare payload
    opt if modifier script is configured
      Webhook-->>Function: modifierFunction({ payload, event })
      Function-->>Function: run
      Function-->>Webhook: return modified payload
    end
    Webhook-->>Endpoint: send payload

```

## Function Definition

The modifier function is called with an object that has the original Payload and the raw Event as attributes:

```javascript
({ payload, event }) => {
    return { payload, event }
}
```

The returned values will be passed on to the configured Endpoint.

| Attribute | Description                                           |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `payload` | Manually configured Payload with placeholders filled. |
| `event`   | Raw event information                                 |

### Async Function

An example of an async-await function is:

```javascript
async ({ payload, event }) => {
    return { payload, event }
}
```
