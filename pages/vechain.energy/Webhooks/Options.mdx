## Data Conversion

Certain data types can be automatically converted before being passed to an endpoint.

- `uint` can converted using `ethers.formatEther` 
- `bytes` can be converted into strings

## Filters

Filters provide the ability to filter data before they are passed to the endpoint.

For example, NFT minting can be detected by filtering transfers from the address(0) (`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`).


## Retry Webhook

In certain situations, resending a webhook may be required.

Single events can be retried from the log details, multiple events from the log list.

## Backfilling

Backfilling allows triggering webhooks for past events, which can be useful for indexing purposes. A selected contract address and the desired block range can retroactively trigger Webhooks.
