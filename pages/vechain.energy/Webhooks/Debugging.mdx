## Test / Simulating Transactions

Simulation allows to verify what happened with a transaction or how the current configuration will be applied to a transaction.

By default, the simulation shows the actions it will perform. Additionally, it is possible to send an HTTP request during the simulation.

The example data can be replaced with the simulation result, if it is successful.

## Endpoint failures

If the backend is unreachable or throws an error code, it will be logged as error and can be filtered in the logs.

Analyzing the response headers and body can help identify the cause of the failure.

## Function failure

If the Webhook Function throws an error, the response status will be `503` and the error message is available in the logs.
