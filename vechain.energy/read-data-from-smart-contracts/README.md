# Read data from smart contracts

Smart contracts are simple programs on a blockchain. They are at the core immutable and provide identical result in identical conditions.

Access to contracts is provided thru a node. A node is a software with access to all history of the blockchain it serves. A node provides an API to access smart contracts and execute functions.

# Write and execute smart contracts

The state of a smart contract can be changed during a transaction. A transaction requires the signature of an authorized user and a gas fee paid in VTHO. The signed transaction is broadcast to a blockchain node. An authorized node updates the smart contract state and documents the transaction.
